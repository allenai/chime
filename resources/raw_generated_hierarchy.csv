Human: Thank you for the detailed response. I have a few follow-up clarifications:

For the top-level aspects in Response 1:
- Please combine ""Efficacy of platinum vs non-platinum regimens"" and ""Alternating vs standard chemotherapy regimens"" into one aspect called ""Comparative efficacy of regimens"".

For the hierarchical categories in Response 2:
- Under ""Treatment regimens for small cell lung cancer"", merge ""Platinum agents"" and ""Non-platinum agents"" into one category called ""Chemotherapy agents"" since they are all chemotherapy.
- Under ""Survival outcomes"", can you break down ""Median survival"" and ""Progression-free survival"" into separate numbered categories for more granularity?

Also, for citing claims, please use a simplified format like ""(Claims: 0, 2, 5)"" instead of listing all claim numbers.

Could you update the response with these changes? Let me know if you have any other questions!"
